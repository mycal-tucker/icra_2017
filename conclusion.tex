This paper addressed the problem of understanding natural language commands within a robot's symbolic world model. The main contribution of the paper was to propose a new probabilistic graphical model called DCG-UPUP-Away, which allows the explicit representation of 1) unknown phrases or objects, and 2) hypothetical objects that can be out of field. Moreover, the proposed model has the capability to learn new symbols in an online fashion, so the learned phrases or objects become known when they are encountered again. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated via simulations and real experiments, where a turtlebot was used and various natural language commands were given. The results indicated that the DCG-UPUP-Away model can ground correct objects approximately $80\%$ of the time. Some potential future directions can be extending the model to reason about multiple unknown (hypothetical) objects or understanding the synonyms of known objects.
